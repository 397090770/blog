Recently Data bricks held a [spark summit](https://spark-summit.org/east-2016/) in New york city. Lots of new exciting news around spark and it's ecosystem got discussed in the different talks of conference. I was watching the videos of the conference on youtube and wanted to share some of the interesting talks from the conference.

These are series of blog posts focusing on various talks categorized into different aspects of Spark. You can access all the posts in the series [here](/categories/spark-summit-east-2016).

This is the first post in the series where I will be sharing interesting talks which where focused on improvements to the core of the spark itself. 

### 1. Matei Zaharia keynote on Spark 2.0

Matei Zaharia, Spark's creator, laid out plans for next version of Spark in his keynote. His talks mainly revolved around performance and new abstraction like Dataset. You can read more about my thoughts on Spark 2.0 here.

The below is the video of the talk. You can find slides on [slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/databricks/2016-spark-summit-east-keynote-matei-zaharia).

### 2. Structuring Spark : Dataframes, Datasets and Spark Streaming

Structured data analysis has become very important part of spark in last few releases. More and more work is done Dataframe API compared to RDD API. In this talk speaker talks about how these API's share common core and how they are planning to bring the same API's for stream analysis also.

The below is the video of the talk. You can find slides on [slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/SparkSummit/structuring-spark-dataframes-datasets-and-streaming-by-michael-armbrust).

### 3. The Future of Real Time Spark - A Revamped Spark Streaming 

Building streaming application is hard. Combining batch processing and stream processing in a single application needs a lot of design and detailed implementation. Compared to other fields of Spark, there was not much going on spark streaming in a while. But no more. Spark 2.0 going to bring a completely new revamped API for spark streaming.

The below is the video of the talk. You can find slides on [slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/rxin/the-future-of-realtime-in-spark).
