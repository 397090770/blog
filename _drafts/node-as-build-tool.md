title: "Node.js- New crossplatform toolkit"
categories: javascript
---
Node.js started as low latency web server written in javascript. It was great hit among the 
javascript developers who wanted use their javascript skills to write server side. But over
years node.js is grown into grown into something completelty different. It has become cross
platform application development tool for creating desktop application and tools. It's kind
of replacing Java to write nice desktop application which exploits all nice things about
web applications

The following are few reasons node.js is good desktop development platform  

Available on all platforms  
Great UI support with all greatness of web
Access to filesystem
Standard package system using npm

Some of the example how people are building some of cool apps using node.js 
nothing to with server programming.

##Atom - Github texteditor written javascript
Texteditor are one of crictical piece of any programming setup. Sublime,Textmate with 
classic vi,emacs rule the game. But having modern texteditor with javascript is always
nice. The atom is one of the first realization of the dream. Before node.js if you wanted 
to create complete js application for desktop you need to run a server process so that
you can talk to filesystem. But with node.js you dont need to run the anymore. 
If you want to try atom you can download [here](https://github.com/atom/atom)

##Bower - Maven of javascript
No more randomly picking up javascript from internet and putting in each page. As we 
have great support dependecy management for language like Java, we got now same for
javascript. Using bower , it joy to bootstrap different projects which uses libraries
like angular.js, polymer. Before bower, we needed to know what css,js to download 
and what to wire where. But with bower its all super easy and straight forward. 
Checkout bower [here](http://bower.io/)

##Grunt - Javascript task runner
We need so many things to automated in development like minimization,running builds etc.
Is it not cool if we can do all this using javascript. Grunt is created for same purpose.
You can script lot of things in Grunt and automate all so that you dont have to worry
anymore.

Checkout [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)

These are 3 applications I use it everyday. The future is interesting
