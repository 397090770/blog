Can a book about mathematical equations will be a interesting read? Yes it can be. In pursuit of unknown takes us to the world of maths in a very interesting story telling way which is never done before. This book is about 17 most important equations of human history.

## General perception of maths

General public thinks maths is tedious brain bending exercise you have to go through in school. Maths is often ranked as most difficult subject to learn in school. Not only that, many people thinks maths is just sheer waste of time. It doesn't has any practical usage in the life.

The reason for these kind of reaction towards maths is nothing to with maths itself. It is something do with the way school teach mathematics. Rather than exciting students about possibility of world exploration using maths, they just make u to learn theorems and solve dry problems. 

This book good example which shows what will be a right way to teach mathematics. As example, I think every one heard of Pythagoras theorem. It's something easy to remember. But from its outlook it doesn't seems to have much of practical usage as most of the shapes we encounter are not triangles and most of triangles we encounter are not right angle. But it's found that any triangle can be divided into two rectangle triangle and any polygon can be divided into multiple triangles. Suddenly pythagoras theorem became the secret key to understand the all kind of shapes. So rather than just teaching the theorem, if you show their universal applicability people will start appreciating more.


## Importance of pure research

Many of the times, maths seems to be less practical. People prefer more practical branches of science like computers, genetic engineering which play direct role in our life.

But as this book shows, many of the breakthroughs in practical areas started as a very non important research. One of the equations, wave equation, which governs the TV, satellite etc started as study the vibration in voilin strings. If you are practitioner or a business person you are never going to pursue research of voilin strings. You may think its just sheer waste of time.

But mathematicians love abstract boring ideas. It proves that by understanding just voilin strings vibration you can understand the universe.

This book opens our eyes to beauty of abstract maths. May be choosing color balls in probability theory makes us laugh, but same underneath maths governs the atoms in a substance. 

## Power of reasoning

One of the hidden theme of the book is to show how wonderful our brain is. Most of the equations discussed in the book are not discovered or derived from experiments. They are invented by sheer power of thinking and reasoning. Some one in remote place, sits in a corner and scribbles on paper to discover the principals governing the universe. It's a very powerful image.

## Why I should read it?

This book several purposes in one book. First of all its fascinating to read the stories behind each discovery. Many of the stories are very colorful and non obvious most of the times. In another level, it brings most influentials mathematics to general public conscience. So if you are science history buff or a mathematics student this book keeps you engaged till the end.
