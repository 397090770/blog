Sbt is official build tool used by Scala ecosystem project. So as you have maven on system
whenever you deal with java projects, it's handy to have sbt on path to do thing with
scala projects. Some days back i need to do some scala developement and I chose a different
path of using Sbt rather than maven as usual. I need to have sbt to compile the project
and getting sbt on ubuntu was not that straight forward. So after going through few blog
posts and Stackover flow , i thought I document in this post
