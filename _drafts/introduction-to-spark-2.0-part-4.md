Spark 2.0 is next major release of popular big data processing framework Apache Spark. This release brings major changes to abstractions, API's and libraries of the platform. This release is setting tone for next year's direction. So understanding these few features is critical to understand for the ones who want to make use all the advances in this new release. So in this series of blog posts, I will be discussing about different aspects of Spark 2.0.

This is the third blog in series, where I will be discussing about catalog API for spark. You can access all the posts in the series here.

TL;DR All code examples are available on github.
