The below video is a recording of my talk on *Building Distributed Systems from Scratch* in recent spark meet up. Itâ€™s first part in series of talks about how to build a distributed processing system from scratch which looks similar to Apache Spark.

Find the slides on [slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/datamantra/building-distributed-systems-from-scratch-part-1) and code on [github](https://github.com/phatak-dev/distributedsystems).
