Over the years, I have watched thousands of movies in various languages from various directors. I am kind of person who go to movies to see director's work rather than an actor or actress. So it is always fascinated how people discover different directors in different point of time of their life and how they can enjoy movies which are 20-30 years old.

These is a new series of posts, where I will be sharing my experience on how I discovered different directors, their movie making styles and how I discovered different movies. 

May be this may help people to discover something new to watch or capture some of finer details which they may have missed.

The first director I am going to talk about is Quentin Torantino.

## Quentin tornatino

Quentin tornatino is my number one favorite in current time. He is one of the rock star director out there. His movies are for very specific pop culture enthusiast people still they are do appeal for broader audience. The reasons I think I like Quentin is

* Novel like screen play
* Incredible music
* Great dialog
* Superb attention to individual scenes


## How I discovered him?

One of my friend, some day suggested to watch *Pulp fiction*. Now by the name of it, it sounded strange. So I gave it a shot. I started to watch without subs, and I gave up. It was so hard to me to follow the dialogs and make sense of it.

Then I watched with subs. One of the striking thing was of whole film how chilled out each specific scenes. Gangster talking non revlevent stuff all the time. Most of the dialogs were not really relevent to the story but they made character look more realistic. I also liked reverse screen play which I liked from Kannada,a Indian language, movies like ssh,A of a director called upendra.

So after pulp fiction,the main take away was the fun is not in overall story. The fun is in enjoying each scene and following characters. This was something different from usual English films I seen till that point of time. Most of the movies are too fast to move the plot along rather than hanging for time. This trends is there in any other directors too.

Once you discover a new director, the obvious next step to see his other movies. The obvious next movie to watch was reservoir dogs. Again same characteristics of pulp but with more strong dialogs and single mindedness. I like reservoir dogs for its simplicity of overall making. It's guys in suits in a warehouse. That's it.

The next film, I watched of Quentin is not what he directed. As I told before I am big fan of his script writing abilities not only directorial ones. So I watched True romance. I loved it. It's something very romantic and violent at same time. The kind of dailogues i never heard in any other movies even in his own movies. It's been one of my favorite movie of all time.

After these first three movie, I watched Jackie brown. I think its one of the lowest rated movies of Quentin. But I liked it again because its hanging low aspect. It's again shows why Quentin all about scenes not about just twisting stories.

Then after words I have seen all of his other movies and all of his interviews too. 

One of the striking factor I realized over time is by watching Quentin movies and interviews, I got introduced to 

* Independent film making
* Scene oriented filming 
* Numerous other independent directors like Rober rodriguez, Kevin smith, Rich hickey etc
* Western classics like Dollar trilogy

So Quentin movie knowledge have been really influential on my movie watch in last few years. This is how I discovered Quentin. We will meet again with new director in next post in the series.
