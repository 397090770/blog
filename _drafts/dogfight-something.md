##Vision

Steve jobs turned company using iPod. Ipod was a big hit for the apple which propelled from 
single digit mac market share to digit consumer company. But iPod was not run away success 
from day one. It took around 2-3 years before it really became the market leader.
At same time Steve jobs also realized that mp3 player are in the great risk once the phone 
can easily play the music and it can be a convergent device. So he wanted to disrupt the 
cell phone market himself in order to protect the great market share of iPhone.

Same time Google wanted to build it search engine directly into the phone.It always feared that
Microsoft will take over search business when they integrate their search, windows live search, directly into the
windows phone. Windows phone also contributed to major part of the smart phone business at that
point of time. So in 2005 they bought android and thought they can build their phone which
has the Google search engine built in. 

So if you see in both cases, iPhone and android started as defensive products for existing 
successful products rather than as a new product itself.

##Cultural Challenge
Apple never build a phone before. There were two different teams with in Apple competing 
to build a phone. One wanted to bring iPod OS to phone and one wanted to bring Mac OSX to the
phone.So both teams team had their own version of Apple phone. Steve jobs being a canny leader
embraced both and seeing which way will win ultimately. Both teams work around few years before decided on running Mac OSX running phone is much better than turning the Ipod into a phone.
So in the book you will be able to get scoop into how these two teams competed against 
each other and their consequences. It had a great great impacted a lot on individuals 
as it involved lots of dirty politics, team tactics and moreover when the whole thing completed a huge amount of people left because they felt betrayed and burnt.

Google's approach this to this is completely different. They never built an OS before or for that never build a consumer product before. They were all about web services and running those web services at scale. Even the co-founder Serge Brin had doubts about android being gelled with Google's culture. Google culture was all about openness. Anyone can look into code , any one can contribute and any one can extend. But when Andy Rubin, co founder of Android, took over the android development within Google, he requested for very strict access to code and no one knew what Android was upto. Which is kind of different for the whole team.

##Technical challenges
Apple never built a phone before which means they have to learn all about phones and
interaction of phone with rest of the world.Being a secret company , they dint help to collaborate with other cellphone companies.They had high bar to achieve. The book gives the details. As an example, One point of time Steve jobs asked one of engineer to build whole phone casing with aluminum . So for long time enginneers tried convincing steve jobs
they should not use aluminum as it blocks the radio signals. But over a time, Steve jobs got what he wanted and engineers able to make a break through to make aluminum work with phones.

Google at same time were thinking about doing the phone business and Andy rubin had exact experience of exactly that. He already done that before with company he founded called Danger, which he later sold it to Microsoft. Still they had their own challenges with UI.
They also have to figure out the interactions with different components.All those kind of things and it took them long time.


##The unveiling of iPhone
Steve jobs was master in unveiling new products. He was always proud of what Apple builds and only you can find few find few cEO's who they r product of their products. So when Steve jobs unveiled  phone , he promised the audience that Apple going to reinvent the phone and he did it.actually it was beyond his own ambitions. It was not big surprise 
that Apple is releasing phone,most of people were expecting it that time. No one expected 
the phone to be so good. Every one was blew away and so did Android team at Google.


When the iPhone got revealed and Andy Rubin was driving and watching this live video through his car. He just blown away. He really knew this was the future. He just picked up the phone and called team right away. "We have to reinvent the UI. Whatever we were doing to use physical keyboard like blackberry , we have to rethink now".

##The Dilemma
Google started to work Android to put it services on the phone business. Now with iPhone, they got their maps and you tube,search on all on iPhone. With iPhone domination in market place, Google got their dreams fulfilled and fear of Microsoft was gone away. So now the real question was what Android going to serve purpose? So there was dedicated team from Google, headed by Vic Gundotra, who worked on iPhone applications and they thought android was just a distraction.

Steve jobs was hearing rumors about Android and he asked Erich Schmidt. Most of the time Google told it just a side project and nothing compared to iPhone. 

So within Google there was dilemma about future .. Is it great apps on iOS or build 
an OS which is going to rival with iOS?.


##Right time,Right thing
Android was right time,right thing.It was till all other carries in realized that
they want a competitive product to iPhone,as iPhone was exclusive to AT&T. Iphone was huge
and AT&T was making lot of money. Everyone wanted an alternative and only Android was viable one. The reason was it was touch ready, it is already built and backed by big company like Google.Suddenly there were people like HTC,Verizon wanted to build phone using
Android.Google also realized Android going to be much more bigger than they imagined.


##Rivalry
Steve jobs already went through a platform war with Microsoft. He don't want to re do the same any other company. He thought iOS software was 5 years ahead any other mobile software out there. He thought if ever there was every going to be competitor, its going to
be Microsoft. Over the time, MS was becoming less relevant in consumer space, as they were concentrating more on enterprise.But when real competition came from somewhere else. It was similar kind of company called Google, where they put all their effort into Android.
When the Droid got release, he got pissed off. He felt betrayed and called Android is just
a rip off of iPhone as Schimdlt was board member of Apple at that time.  


So the book gives kind a high level view , intimacy view things that happed in last 5-6 years where both Google and Apple in different ways created Gigantic smart phone market. They collaborated with each other for search,maps,you tube and but they competitive on OS.Google being lucky being right time , right place. 

So this book goes beyond just the rivalry that you may read in blogs. So if you are interested to know the history of Smart phone this book is must read. It just another MS vs Apple  repetition. When platform war happens, it one takes it all situation.It's also highly authentic as sources come from reputed blogs and court testimonies. So go and grab a copy of yours.
