<article class="post-content">
  <p>It is the forth article of ongoing series “Cloud computing-not only for big boys”.
After knowing the cloud and its features , we have to be very careful in choosing and using cloud services.</p>

<p>Though price is major deciding factor, we have to take care of other factors too. This article gives you the 5golden rule of cloud computing that you should follow.</p>

<h3 id="always-backup-your-cloud-data">1. Always backup your cloud data</h3>

<p>Cloud is not a error-free environment. So when there is an outage in cloud servers , there is always possibility of data loss.Recent Microsoft SideKick incident is one of the ugly incident that made many customers to loose their data permanently.So always backup your data in a safe place like your hard disk , portable hard disk etc</p>

<h3 id="dont-store-your-personal-data-in-cloud">2. Don’t store your personal data in cloud</h3>

<p>Security one of the major challenge in cloud computing. Research is going on to find a perfect security model for the cloud .But its not yet implemented. So don’t store your personal sensitive data</p>

<h3 id="share-with-care">3. Share with Care</h3>

<p>When you share the data on cloud you should be very careful .Since though you delete your copy of data it will remain in the cloud since its shared with others. So when you want to share the data be sure about person and content.</p>

<h3 id="spend-some-time-to-read-privacy-policy">4. Spend some time to read privacy policy</h3>

<p>In cloud computing paradigm privacy plays a huge role. So when you sign-up for a cloud service please spend time reading the privacy policy of the cloud service providers.Don’t blindly press OK for everything.</p>

<h3 id="choose-a-stronger-password">5.Choose a stronger password</h3>

<p>Its a general care that to be taken when you use the web applications. But the need of stronger password is increased with increased use of cloud computing.</p>

<p>An research study says its only takes $45 and some hours to crack a 8 character password. So its good practice to use at least 12 character passwords.</p>

<p>Tell us what you think about these rules?</p>
