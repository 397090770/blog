The below video is a recording of my talk on *Building Distributed Systems from Scratch - Part 2* in recent spark meet up. Itâ€™s second talk in series of talks about how to build a distributed processing system from scratch which looks similar to Apache Spark. This talk focuses on how to implement a system to distribute third party libraries on mesos.
