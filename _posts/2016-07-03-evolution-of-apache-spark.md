The below video is recording of my talk on *Evolution of Apache Spark : Journey of Spark in 1.x Series* in recent spark meetup. In this talk, we will discuss how apache spark has undergone tremendous changes in API and implementation in last two years. Talk also discusses how big data industry is embracing these changes. Understanding these changes makes us prepared for new things getting introduced in spark 2.0.
