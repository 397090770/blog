I am very happy to tell you that we have finally released the first version of [Nectar](https://github.com/zinniasystems/nectar) ,the first open source predictive modeling framework on Apache Hadoop. Being a part of the development team  Nectar, I want to share some of the insights of the framework and Apache Hadoop in general.

###Apache Hadoop : LAMP of new era  
Back in 1990â€™s, LAMP (Linux,Apache,MySql,Perl/PHP) stack  enabled many start ups to build innovative products. Some of them became big companies like Google,Twitter,Facebook etc., which redefined the whole Web. With the practice of open source, these companies have emerged a great way.

Now, in the scenario of solving Big Data problems, Apache Hadoop, finds the best fit. It gives a powerful stack to build powerful applications. Its vibrant community and Apache licence makes it very attractive for start ups to use as its base .Some of the companies like cloud era,Karma sphere are trying to build the innovative products on Hadoop.


###Nectar : Predictive Modeling meets Apache Hadoop  
Here in [Zinnia Systems](http://www.zinniasystems.com) we see Apache Hadoop one of the most powerful stack. But with power, complexity creeps in. Though Hadoop is powerful in nature its complex to use. This is because, it must be thought in terms of Map/Reduce . So we thought, we can develop a framework which helps to abstract the map/reduce and just focus on the application. Thus we developed nectar, which provides the basic modeling algorithm like regression as simple as a java API .

We have open sourced the framework and we believe, open source is the best model to promote,encourage and envision the innovation. So, if you are interested about Hadoop and want to play with modeling problems, then have a look at our framework.

All the details about the project is made available in following links.
