<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Art is as complex as we are. It is hard for any one of us, artist or not, to understand who we are and what we genuinely do and art, which comes out of this creative chaos, reflects our situation and helps us to recognize its variations, how we connect and disconnect with other people, places and ideas.</span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">For people who don't know what art is about, or for those who see it as belonging to the few, art needs to be relevant to people's daily experience, hopes and aspirations. Then it can begin to inspire people to transform not just themselves but also the world around them.</span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">We all have the perception to play and work with our active and vivid imaginations. Artists help us to connect with ideas of making and destroying so that we may feel more confident about renewal rather than frightened of change.</span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Art can transform the non-human into the human, the formless into the formed, the everyday into the profound, the passing into the permanent, the gathering into a community, the city into an idea.</span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Art is where we practice being fully human.</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Art moves us forward …. So can I see this to be a future?? Integrated with our lives?? With technology?? Hope I’m not wrong…</span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.googleartproject.com/">Google Art Project</a> was one step!!</span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">And I just wish it becomes a cutting edge to the technology we are about to envision…</span></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/jODW/~4/Uu5wZarWVm4" height="1" width="1"/>
