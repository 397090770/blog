Spark 2.0 is the next major release of Apache Spark. This release brings major changes to abstractions, API's and libraries of the platform. This release sets the tone for next year's direction of the framework. So understanding these few features is critical to understand for the ones who want to make use all the advances in this new release. So in this series of blog posts, I will be discussing about different improvements landing in Spark 2.0.

This is the seventh blog in the series.You can access all the posts in the series [here](/categories/spark-two/).

The below video is recording of my talk on *Introduction to Spark 2.0 : Next Step in Spark Journey* in recent spark meetup. In this talk, I have discussed about new abstractions and new API's introduced in latest version of spark.
