Whenever I talk about Spark in meetup or training, people ask one question **"Do I need to know hadoop for learning Spark?"**. My answer to this question was "not in the beginning". In my view, to learn spark you don't need to know about hadoop. But if you want to be proficient in spark, then knowing hadoop concepts is a must.

So in below video I have captured neccessary HDFS and Map/Reduce concepts which are needed for improving understanding of Spark. This video is for all the ones who has some understanding of Spark and want to know how ideas from hadoop and spark connect.
