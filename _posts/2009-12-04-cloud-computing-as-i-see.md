*I think whether you’re an enterprise or an individual, it rarely makes sense for you to have your own buildings, fiber cables and infrastructure. It takes a lot of time and effort to maintain. Ultimately, your resources are available to you wherever you are, and you want those things there. There’s an economy of scale that makes that easier and more powerful because there’s a lot of interoperability that’s not otherwise possible.
There’s less time-burn in managing your digital life*. - Sergey Brin , Google Co-founder

*We believe that the cloud is a game-changing paradigm shift* - Lanham Napier , Rackspace CEO

*It's stupidity. It's worse than stupidity: it's a marketing hype campaign
One reason you should not use web applications to do your computing is that you lose control* - Richard Stallman,FSF founder

*The interesting thing about cloud computing is that we've redefined cloud computing to include everything that we already do. I can't think of anything that isn't cloud computing with all of these announcements. The computer industry is the only industry that is more fashion-driven than women's fashion. Maybe I'm an idiot, but I have no idea what anyone is talking about. What is it? It's complete gibberish. It's insane. When is this idiocy going to stop?.We'll make cloud computing announcements. I'm not going to fight this thing. But I don't understand what we would do differently in the light of cloud.*
- Larry Ellison , Oracle CEO


*Cloud computing is the future of Open Source* - Jonathan Schwartz, CEO , Sun Microsystems


*In the extreme case, we can take some body's data center and run it for them on the cloud. All the issues about administrative, capacity, who owns the data, what happens when things go wrong, when people are getting error messages, that's cloud computing and there is a lot of deep invention and work*
- Bill Gates ,Co-founder of Microsoft
