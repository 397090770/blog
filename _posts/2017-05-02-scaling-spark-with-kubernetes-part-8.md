date : 2017-05-02
categories: scala spark kubernetes-series

In last few blog posts on kubernetes, we have discussed how to build scalable spark cluster on kubernetes platform. 
Recently I gave a talk on these topics in a our spark [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Bangalore-Apache-Spark-Meetup/). It was focused on importance of micro
service architecture for big data development and deployment using kubernetes.

In this eighth blog of the series, I will be sharing recording of that talk with slides and code.
You can access all the posts in the series [here](/categories/kubernetes-series).


Find the slides on [slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/datamantra/scalable-spark-deployment-using-kubernetes) and code on [github](https://github.com/phatak-dev/kubernetes-spark).
