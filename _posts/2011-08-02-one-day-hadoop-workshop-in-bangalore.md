After releasing [Nectar](https://github.com/zinniasystems/nectar), our open source analytics framework, we got a positive feedback and many of them wanted to know more about how we use hadoop in our company and get started with the hadoop development. So, we thought that a workshop on Hadoop would be great idea.

Thus, we have arranged a workshop about Hadoop on 20th August ,2011 held at Bangalore. In the workshop, we have scheduled events as how we are using hadoop to build our own analytics products and about Nectar.We are also going to talk about how you can use Hadoop in your organization. We will be having hands on experience for the attendees in the labs to setup the hadoop cluster,running map/reduce jobs etc.For more details about the event , refer this [page](http://hadoopworkshop.eventbrite.com/).

###Hadoop and small things

As you know Hadoop always wants to play with Big Data . It doesnâ€™t like small files. Initially, we  thought we are going to have workshop for 10 people and the tickets were made free. But within 12 hours, all the tickets were sold out !!!  Now, we have a workshop for 30 people, by adding 20 more paid tickets.On a lighter side, we learnt that we cannot do small things with Hadoop! ;)

So, if you are interested in Hadoop event and want to know more about it, then do come and join us in the workshop. You can register [here](http://hadoopworkshop.eventbrite.com/).
