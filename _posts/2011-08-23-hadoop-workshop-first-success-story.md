We completed our first hadoop workshop on 20th August with great success . This post summarizes some of the insights and feedback we got from the event.

People love to learn a new hot technology in market. So many people are interested to learn Hadoop but they just did not have the right place to start. I think our workshop gave them the right platform to kick start in hadoop. We sold all our 17 tickets to the event within few days. So we even sold out next workshop tickets and the third workshop tickets are already selling . Yeah! its on fire.. We are doing small workshops to get the feedback and improve the overall experience.

Out of 17 , twelve people attended the workshop. Participants thoroughly enjoyed the interactive sessions and expressed that the hands on were great . The hands on went as planned which gave the participants an insight to hadoop and map/reduce .Putting in their own words,the following is what the people expressed....

“Great work by small company having effective people...Impressed! I want to have the same training once again” -Vijesh

“Good and Interactive sessions delivered.Nice job by Madhu and company”	-Devang Gandhi
"Hands-on trainings were good" -Uma Mahewari

"Content delivery was very good" -Puneetha


With this kind of positive response we are charged to host more workshops. We sold out few tickets for students which is a student centric workshop on 27th Aug . People already signing up for our third workshop . So if you are interested you can register [here](http://hadoopworkshopsept.eventbrite.com/)  asap , since we are sure that we are going to sell out that soon.

We are also launching advanced trainings particularly for the workshop attendees which gives opportunities them to go deep into Hadoop and start their carrier as a Hadoop developer .If you know hadoop and if you want to know more this will be a great opportunity. 

So overall it was a great experience and it gave the feeling that we are in a right path. 
If you are interested in Hadoop and its ecosystem meet us at any of the above events. We can assure you that it would be a great experience for you.
