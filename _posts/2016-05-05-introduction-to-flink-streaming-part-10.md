In our flink [series](/categories/flink-streaming), we have discussed different aspects of flink streaming API. Recently I gave a talk, Introduction to Flink Streaming, which captures all of this and more in a 2 hour talk. 

In this post, I am sharing the recording of that talk. Find the slides on [slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/datamantra/introduction-to-flink-streaming) and code on [github](https://github.com/phatak-dev/flink-examples).
