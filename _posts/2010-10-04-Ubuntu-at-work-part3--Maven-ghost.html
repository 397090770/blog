This Maven ghost is not unique to Ubuntu . He can be seen in windows version of eclipse too.So what does he do? He just makes all maven dependencies disappear from Eclipse !!!. Deadly dangerous right?<br /><br />After getting back all my plug ins , i was a happy worker. But Eclipse was not happy.So it launched maven ghost against me.One evening i see all the maven dependencies are disappeared from package explorer. The project was building fine which means all dependencies were there.But they just disappeared from the eclipse view.<br /><br />I restarted Eclipse .No effect. I cleaned it so many times.No effect.I rebooted my system itself . No effect.So started to Googling about it. After one hour of search i found out that two small setting will change everything. I am sharing with you this , may be it will be useful if you come across this ghost.<br /><br />For every project ,Eclipse maintains a .classpath file. Just add the following line to the .classpath file of the project in which maven dependencies are missing.<br /><br />classpathentry kind="con" path="org.maven.ide.eclipse.MAVEN2_CLASSPATH_CONTAINER"<br /><br />This enables the eclipse to show maven dependency folder.<br /><br />That's not enough. By this setting it only some jars . If you want to see all dependencies<br />got to .settings folder. Then in org.maven.ide.eclipse.prefs change<br /><br />includeModules=false<br /><br />to<br />includeModules=true<br /><br />Just restart the Eclipse.<br /><br />Maven Dependencies are back and ghost is not here. May be he went to your place , just be aware :)<br />Update : This ghost is unique to Maven plug in 0.10 version. It does not appear in 0.98 version<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/jODW/~4/_f9dBMn2rbk" height="1" width="1"/>
